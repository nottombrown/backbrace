In order to build Backbrace, you need...

docco (apt-get install node, npm; then npm install docco)
pygments (easy_install pygments)
coffeescript

If you don't have pygments, you'll get an "EPIPE, Broken pipe" error
in node.js.  This is wonderfully unhelpful; just install pygments as
above and it will go away.
