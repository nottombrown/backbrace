Backbrace.js
============

Backbrace provides higher-level functionality on top of Backbone, an
excellent library that (in its authors' words) "provides structure for
JavaScript applications."  Backbrace began life as a collection of
generic pieces we put together while writing the SolidStage web
frontend.  We're releasing them in the hope that they'll be useful for
other people, too!

Documentation is available at http://solidstage.github.com/backbrace

This version of Backbrace is intended for use with:

- Backbone 0.5.3
- Underscore 1.2.3
- jQuery 1.7.1

These are simply the latest versions of each library at the time of
this writing.  Other recent versions will probably work fine, too.  If
they don't, please send us a bug report!

Backbrace is distributed under the MIT license, the full text of which
is available in LICENSE.  In short: use it for anything that makes you
happy; if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
